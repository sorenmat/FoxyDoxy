 * # Foxy Doxy
 *
 * This is a library for generating documentation from the code base.
 *
 * How does this differ from JavaDoc ?
 *
 * JavaDoc was designed to document Java APIs, and is good at that. But in order for the user to find the documentation,
 * you need to know what class to look for.
 *
 * Sometimes you need an other kind of documentation. Let's say you would describe the flow of the application, the bootstrapping process or some other kind
 * that spans multiple classes and concepts.
 *
 * But at the same time you need it close to the source code, in order for it to be kept up to date.
 *
 * __Then Foxy Doxy is the tool for you.__
